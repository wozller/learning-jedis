# learning-jedis-and-google-cloud
An attempt to learn about Jedis (Java client for Redis) and Google Cloud connectivity with Java. I want to learn how Jedis is used and to see if I can tap into its caching and database capabilities. I also want to see if I can connect my application to Google Cloud.
